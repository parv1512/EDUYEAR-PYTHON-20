	<h3>
    <b>Python</b> is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. 
    Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
    Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
    Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
